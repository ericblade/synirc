SynIRC - IRC client for classic webOS Synergy Messaging

This code is freely available to all, do what you will with it.  Includes "node-irc" package, (c) Martyn Smith, which is GPL-3.0 licensed.

If anyone wants to mess with this, I'd be happy to accept pull requests.

Please fork and give credit where credit is due, play nice :-)

com.ericblade.synirc_1.0.0_all.ipk is the package that was last used when I last used the app several years prior.  It was in working
condition at that point in time.  If you want to mess around with this, I would suggest getting it working as is first, then seeing if it's
possible to upgrade the version of node-irc used.
